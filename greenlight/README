bbb-video-download Integration into greenlight.

adapted from https://gitlab.rlp.net/rzht-public/3b-download

The original /etc/nginx/snippets/greenlight.nginx has to be adapted
with the changes like the example in this directory:

This has to be changed at the start of the file:

location /b {
  sub_filter '<!-- Global javascript variables and helpers. -->'
             '<!-- Global javascript variables and helpers. --><script src="/bbb-download/injector.js?$pid" data-turbolinks-track="reload"></script>';

This has to be added (at the end):

location /bbb-download {
  alias /opt/bbb-download/htdocs;
#  try_files $uri $uri/ @nested;
  location ~ \.php$ {
      include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
      fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $request_filename;
      fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.3-fpm.sock;
  }
  location ~ /\.ht {
      deny all;
  }
  index index.php;
  add_header Last-Modified $date_gmt;
  if_modified_since off;
  etag off;
}
location /bbb-download/file/ {
  internal;
  alias /path-to-recordings/published/presentation/;
}

php-fpm has to be enabled in nginx.
